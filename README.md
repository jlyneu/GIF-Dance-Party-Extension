# GIF-Dance-Party-Extension
A Chrome Extension inspired by http://gifdanceparty.giphy.com/

## Turn even the most intolerable websites into an animated rave
Fan of Fuzzy Wobble's [original dance party](http://gifdanceparty.giphy.com/)? Well, now
is your chance to take the party to any website of your choice! Expanding your professional
network on LinkedIn can be a chore sometimes, but you will only have a better experience
if you further bloat their UI with Katy Perry's Left Shark or an overweight Spiderman
getting down to Hotline Bling. Just install the GIF Dance Party Chrome Extension, and
click on the disco ball to the right of Chrome's address bar to get the party started!

## Customize your party
Although this Chrome Extension already comes with an army of GIF dancers and a bumpin' set of
audio loops, you probably have some awesome GIF dancers or songs in mind that we aren't aware of.
You can toss those dancers or songs into the bunch when this Chrome Extension is running to make
your party even better. Just pop open the *ADD DANCER* or *SELECT SONG* menu and paste in the
corresponding URL.

## Share your party!
No party is fun by yourself! We encourage you to record or take screenshots of your GIF Dance Party
and send them to your friends! Heck -- you can even encourage them to install the extension as well.
If you can't seem to share it enough, then send it over to GDPExtension@gmail.com since we'd love to
see it too!

## Make the party better
If you have ideas on how to make the party better, feel free to create a pull request or send your feedback to
GDPExtension@gmail.com. We also might be updating the Chrome Extension with more GIF dancers and music.
If you think that you've found the perfect media for this Chrome Extension, then we might push it out!
